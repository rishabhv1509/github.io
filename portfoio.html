                    <p class="para">I have no job experience yet. But have gained a lot of experience in my projects during my BTech degree. Currently, Iam learning web devolopment from Edwisor.With the help of Edwisor, 
                        I have learned about new version of javascript i.e.
                         ES6 and now Iam currently leaning about how to make a web page responsive with all possible resolutions.I also opted for android development course during my summer training in Chandigarh 
                         in previous year.

                            I have a great knowledge of how to make UI good looking. I am also good in dealing with PHP i.e to fetch a validated data from database,to pass credentials from android app or a website to database using PHP, to parse data
                             from database in JSON form etc. I also have a little knowledge about handelling API. I also created an online examination website for my college with my project mates. Iam very good in backend section.
                            
                            My experience with edwisor has been very great.The videos by Aditya Kumar are very helpful. Each and every doubt was cleared through discussion and ticket section.I knew very little about CSS and its properties and was very weak in my frontend section.But with the help of edwisor.com,I came to learn a lot about css and its properties.Now Iam capable of making webpage myself. Iam very thankful to Edwisor.com. </p>
